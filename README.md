#DESCRIPTION: The Task-2-Automated-Report-Generator is a Python-based project designed to simplify and automate the process of generating PDF reports from CSV data. In many business, academic, or research scenarios, preparing reports manually can be tedious, time-consuming, and prone to errors. This project addresses this challenge by providing a fully automated solution that reads raw data from a CSV file, processes it using Python scripts, and outputs a well-structured, formatted PDF report. The solution is efficient, easy to use, and requires minimal manual intervention.
The project consists of three main components:
Data Input – The data.csv file contains the raw dataset that needs to be summarized or reported.
Report Generation Scripts – The report_generator folder contains Python scripts that process the data, calculate necessary summaries, and format the output report.
Output Report – The final result is the output_report.pdf file, which is automatically created based on the data and formatting logic defined in the scripts.
This project demonstrates practical applications of Python in data handling, report automation, and PDF generation, making it an excellent tool for data analysts, students, and professionals who need to generate reports quickly and accurately.
